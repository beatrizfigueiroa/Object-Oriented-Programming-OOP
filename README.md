# Object-Oriented-Programming-OOP

This project was proposed by my programming professor Diego Pinheiro

Activity proposed: Make all Junit tests pass

Hints:

For the Pair Class -->  *Create a constructor;
		        *Override the toString method;
		        *Override the equals method

For the Pairing Class --> *Create a private method called getList;
			  *Create a private method called ObtainPairs
			  (this method must return a a vector of type Pair);
		          *Create a constructor.
			  
Example of input:
String s1 = "Person 1, Person 3, Person 5";
String s2 = "Person 2, Person 4, Person 6";

Output of pairing.toString(): 
"(Person 1, Person 2), (Person 3, Person 4), (Person 5, Person
6)"
