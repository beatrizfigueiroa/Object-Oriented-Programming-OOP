# Object-Oriented-Programming-OOP

This project was proposed by my programming professor Diego Pinheiro

Activity proposed: Make all Junit tests pass

Hints:

For the Pair Class -->  *Create a constructor;
		                  	*Override the toString method;
		                  	*Override the equals method

For the Pairing Class --> *Create a private method called getList;
			                    *Create a private method called ObtainPairs (this method must return a a vector of type Pair);
		                  	  *Create a constructor;
