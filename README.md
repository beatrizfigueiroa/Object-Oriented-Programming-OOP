# Object-Oriented-Programming-OOP

This project was proposed by my programming professor Diego Pinheiro

Activity proposed: Make all Junit tests pass

Hints:

For the Pair Class:

		1.Create a constructor;


		2.Override the toString method;
		     
		     
		3.Override the equals method

For the Pairing Class:

		1.Create a private method called getList;


		2.Create a private method called ObtainPairs
			  (this method must return a a vector of type Pair);
			  
			  
		3.Create a constructor.
			  
Example of input:
String s1 = "Person 1, Person 3, Person 5";
String s2 = "Person 2, Person 4, Person 6";

Output of pairing.toString(): 
"(Person 1, Person 2), (Person 3, Person 4), (Person 5, Person
6)"
